# 🎮 Obstacle Physics Test Game

## 📌 About The Project

This project is a Unity-based game prototype built to apply core game development concepts including physics-based player movement, Cinemachine camera systems, environment interaction, obstacle mechanics, scoring systems, and basic game flow.

The project was developed as a hands-on implementation of Unity fundamentals such as input handling, collision detection, triggers, prefabs, and level design. It serves as a technical sandbox to practice gameplay scripting, physics tuning, and scene construction.
